# Our Mission

Is this your first time to a top conference? Have you ever wanted your own work recognized by this huge and active community? Do you encounter difficulties in polishing your ideas, experiments, paper writing, etc? Then, this session is exactly for you!

This year, we are hosting again the New in ML workshop, co-locating with [ICML 2022](https://icml.cc/). This workshop is intended for anyone who has not published a paper at a top conference yet (e.g. ICML, NeurIPS). We invited top researchers to review your work and share their experience with you. The best papers will get oral presentations and awards!

<p align="center">
  <img src="imgs/newinml_fig_topics.jpg" width="250" />
</p>

Our biggest goal is to help you publish papers at the next ICML conference, and generally provide you with the guidance you need to contribute to ML research fully and effectively!


Within quota limits, the authors of the best accepted papers may be receiving tickets to ICML 2022, to be attributed according to merit and need. In addition, we should be able to provide **financial help** for travel/accommodation/registration expanses and fees.

# Data Challenge opportunity: Cross-Domain MetaDL (NeurIPS 2022)
Here is a quick summary regarding a very interesting data challenge for NewInML folks. More details can be found in this [extended abstract](papers/cross_domain_metadl_data_challenge.pdf) and on the [challenge website](https://metalearning.chalearn.org/).

The new **Cross-Domain MetaDL challenge** is part of the ChaLearn meta-learning series. It has a **special league for New in ML participants (with prizes and certificates)** and a detailed tutorial with no prerequisites (i.e., no previous meta-learning knowledge required). The competition is part of the **NeurIPS'22 program**, and the winners will be invited to co-author the analysis paper with the organizers to appear in PMLR.
The focus is on "cross-domain" meta-learning, aiming at leveraging experience from previous tasks to solve new tasks efficiently. While our previous challenge addressed within-domain few-shot learning for N-way k-shot tasks (i.e., N class classification problems with k training examples), **this challenge proposes "any-way" and "any-shot" tasks drawn from various domains (healthcare, ecology, biology, manufacturing, and others)**, chosen for their humanitarian and societal impact. Code submissions will be blind-tested on CodaLab, and the winners' code will be open-sourced.
**Submissions are open between July 01 and August 31, 2022.**
