# Our Mission

Is this your first time to a top conference? Have you ever wanted your own work recognized by this huge and active community? Do you encounter difficulties in polishing your ideas, experiments, paper writing, etc? Then, this session is exactly for you!

This year, we are hosting again the New in ML workshop, co-locating with [ICML 2022](https://icml.cc/). This workshop is intended for anyone who has not published a paper at a top conference yet (e.g. ICML, NeurIPS). We invited top researchers to review your work and share their experience with you. The best papers will get oral presentations and awards!

<p align="center">
  <img src="imgs/newinml_fig_topics.jpg" width="250" />
</p>

Our biggest goal is to help you publish papers at the next ICML conference, and generally provide you with the guidance you need to contribute to ML research fully and effectively!


Within quota limits, the authors of the best accepted papers may be receiving tickets to ICML 2022, to be attributed according to merit and need. In addition, we should be able to provide **financial help** for travel/accommodation/registration expanses and fees.
